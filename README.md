# Identification of skull sutures from CT scan

# Project Objectives 
The primary objectives of this project are to design and implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of accurately identifying skull sutures in CT scans of synapsids from the NHM collection. This tool aims to advance our comprehension of synapsid skull structure and evolution, facilitating detailed morphological analyses. Additionally, the project seeks to establish a methodology that can be applied to broader paleontological and evolutionary biology research, enhancing our understanding of vertebrate development and evolution.
# Project Description 
This project centres on the development of an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to detect and analyse skull sutures within CT scans of synapsids, sourced from the esteemed Natural History Museum (NHM) collection. Skull sutures, the fusion lines where different bones converge during the growth and development of an organism, play a critical role in understanding the anatomy, functionality, and evolutionary progression of vertebrates, particularly synapsids. By leveraging advanced CNN methodologies, this research aims to pinpoint these sutures with high precision, thereby facilitating a more nuanced exploration of synapsid cranial structures.
The significance of this endeavour extends beyond the mere identification of sutural lines; it endeavours to contribute profoundly to our comprehension of vertebrate evolution and development. The detailed analysis of skull sutures, enabled by this project, will offer fresh insights into the developmental biology and evolutionary dynamics of synapsids, a pivotal group in the history of terrestrial vertebrates. Through this project, we aim to establish a robust analytical tool that can be utilized in various fields of paleontological research, potentially influencing future studies in evolutionary biology, comparative anatomy, and beyond. This endeavour not only enhances our scientific understanding but also underscores the potential of integrating computational techniques with traditional paleontological analyses.
